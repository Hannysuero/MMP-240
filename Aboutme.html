		I have 20 Years old and right know i'm studing Digital Marketing at BMCC, this is my 3er semester and i hope to graduated on next semester Fall 2026. I have a lot of spectation about this class because the class i take before was a combination of diferents tecnies and we dont get to much time to work on the desing of web and for me that was the most intersting of all. I hope to be able to learn more in this class.</p>
